Machine-DB version 0.01
=======================
This program implements a MQTT-based interface to a database. In order
to work, it subscribes to a list of MQTT topics defined in its
configuration file. Each topic may define one or more SQL statements
to execute on the database and possibly, the definition of a response
MQTT message.

The program parses incoming messages (both the topic and the body of
the message) looking for the value of pre-defined fields. These fields
are then stored in a sort of clipboard, a hash of fields. SQL statements
take their parameters from this hash and they put their results
back in the hash as well. Finally, if there is a response, it may take
fields from the hash and send these field values back in the message
topic or body.

This program is able to retrieve a single row of data from the database.
